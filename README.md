### Hi! I'm Davi

I develop tools to understand and interpret large sets of data, particularly those generated by [single-cell omics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-cell_analysis). 

-  I've developed [TopOMetry](https://topometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a comprehensive framework for dimensional reduction with modular steps that allow to compute dozens of different methods for learning latent structure in the form of similarity graphs, orthogonal bases, and 2- or 3-D layouts with a single line of code. It was designed to be compatible with a [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) centered workflow, as most classes and functions can be pipelined. 
  
-  The earlier version of the diffusion models in TopOMetry  model was useful for analyzing a [meta-analysis of human lung scRNAseq data to provide new insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76488-2). The R code used is also available in a [public repository](https://github.com/davisidarta/humanlung).

-  I lead a small bioinformatics team at the Laboratory of Cell Signaling, where I attend as a PhD candidate, under supervision of [Prof. Licio Velloso](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DKuRdBsAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR). I've also held a workshop on single-cell data analysis at our lab, currently [available](https://github.com/OCRC/TreinamentoSingleCell) in Brazilian Portuguese. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only material on this topic in Portuguese.

Currently, I'm working on improving an acessory package to TopOMetry, [CellTOMetry](), which integrates with the current python computational environment for single-cell data analysis. 

I'm always open to interesting conversations and enjoy getting involved in many projects. Feel free to reach me by [email](mailto:davisidarta@fcm.unicamp.br). 


I tweet about medicine, computational biology, machine-learning, and sometimes about my personal life.
