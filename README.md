### Hi! I'm Davi


I develop tools to understand and interpret high-dimensional data, with a focus on [single-cell omics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-cell_analysis). 


-  I developed [TopOMetry](https://topometry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a comprehensive framework for high-dimensional data analysis. TopOMetry learns similarity graphs, estimates the dimensionality of the data, obtains latent dimensions using topological operators, clusters samples and layouts topological graphs into two-dimensional visualizations. TopOMetry learns and evaluates dozens of possible visualizations so that users do not have to stick with any pre-determined model (e.g. t-SNE or UMAP). It was designed to be compatible with a [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) centered workflow, as most classes and functions can be pipelined. TopOMetry manuscript is freely available at [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.14.484134v1).
  
  
-  I'm currently a postdoc at [Ana Domingos' lab](https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/team/ana-domingos) at the University of Oxford. We are working on generating and analyzing single-cell datasets from a variety of tissues relevant to obesity and metabolism to build updated comprehensive neuroanatomical maps with cellular resolution. These will serve as a foundation for new studies investigating cellular-specific therapeutic targets for obesity and its comorbidities.


I'm always open to interesting conversations and enjoy getting involved in many projects. Feel free to reach me by [email](mailto:davi.oliveira@dpag.ox.ac.uk). 


I tweet about medicine, neuroscience, computational biology, machine learning, and sometimes about my personal life.
